*Reference 1:* [Original theme](https://github.com/oskarkrawczyk/honukai-iterm-zsh)  
*Reference 2:* [Oh-My-Posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/themes/honukai.omp.json)

These are CSS colors for terminal emulators that accept CSS colors in their config files like "Tabby" https://tabby.sh/
I attempted to create a "color theme file" and "theme plug-in" but saw no way to implement them in settings, so I went the CSS route. See more robust IDE theme version below.

-----
The IDE versions below have way more colors extrapolated for IDE use case.

SEE [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/chrisdigital/honukai-theme/blob/main/honukai-dark-blue-theme-vsc-1.3/CHANGELOG.md) FOR SUPPORTED LANGUAGES AND UPDATES.
